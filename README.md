# HeartSpot-DICOM
An AI-powered model for localizing the heart in medical DICOM images using bounding box annotations. This project uses data from the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge to accurately detect and visualize the heart region, supporting cardiac analysis in radiology.

### Cardiac Detection Model for Localizing the Heart in DICOM Images

This project aims to detect and localize the heart in medical DICOM images by creating bounding box annotations. The model utilizes labeled data from the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge dataset to train and validate its localization capability.

---

## Project Overview

This project includes a notebook that preprocesses, annotates, and visualizes heart detection data:

- **Bounding Boxes**: Identifies and annotates heart locations in each image with bounding boxes.
- **Visualization**: Displays bounding boxes over images for accuracy verification.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises DICOM images with labeled bounding boxes that indicate the heart region:
